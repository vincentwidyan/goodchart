## Introduction
Coloring cell in Excel is as easy as select color on __Fill Cell__ option in __Home__ menu. But the issue happen if we have range of cells that we want to color, and we want they are dynamically change -- _in terms of saturation or luminosity_ -- based on the value of its cells.
We absolutely don't want to color them manually and change whenever the value change. So, we could use __Conditional Formatting__.

    <div class="border rounded-sm p-1 justify-center max-w-[350px] [&_img,p]:m-0">
